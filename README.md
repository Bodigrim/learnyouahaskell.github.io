# Learn You a Haskell: A community version

Hey yo! [learnyouahaskell.github.io](https://learnyouahaskell.github.io/) is an **open-source** fork of the original **Learn You a Haskell** (**LYAH** for short) by Miran Lipovaƒça, "the funkiest way to learn Haskell, the best functional programming language around". This guide is meant for people who have programmed already, but have yet to try functional programming.

**Now, why did I create this fork?** ("fork" means a copy of an original which may be modified or extended)
Well, I began learning Haskell in 2021 at my undergrad studies and quickly came across LYAH ([link for original](http://learnyouahaskell.com/)). I immediately fell in love and followed it to supplement my journey of learning Haskell.

However, I quickly realised some parts are slowly becoming outdated as Haskell continues to evolve. That is why, with the author's blessing, I decided to create this open-source fork to enable the Haskell community to participate in preserving and maintaining this awesome resource for the future times.

Anyone is invited to **contribute** be either opening a pull request (preferred) or opening a content edit request (in the pipeline, open soon!) for proposed changes.

The whole thing is completely free to read online, but the original is also available in print and we encourage you to buy a copy!

*This is still a work in progress. Happy for any suggestions or feedback!*

## TODOs:
- [ ] refactor web code
- [ ] make mobile-friendly
- [ ] prepare "content edit request" interface on GitHub
- [ ] add exercises
- [ ] update (just overall, the outdated parts)

Don't forget to star star the GitHub repository if you like it! üôÇ
